Hello,
Here is a group from class p8105, Data Science. In this website you see our final project research. 
Our group members are all from Columbia University. You can find more information about us from this [link](about.html) or from the tab above. 

## Abstract ##


## Introduction ## 

## Data Cleaning ## 
Raw data hsa been obtained from [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/). The data was chosen from the [CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survery website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_HIQ.htm), collected from 2017 to March 2020 pre-pandemic period. In order for further analysis, the data set was cleaned and merged as our output. 

All the data files were saved in our github folder, and you can visit them via [https://github.com/Meltaria/8105_FP_YH_HM_JM_MD.github.io.git](https://github.com/Meltaria/8105_FP_YH_HM_JM_MD.github.io.git). The file, __nhanes__, is the data frame containing all these six distinct data files. You may taken a close look about the detailed procedure of [data cleaning](data_cleaning.html)

These six data set includes Alcohol Use, Demographics, Hepatitis, Health Insurance, Immunization and Income. All the duplicated data was eliminated and only the data from those, who are 18 years and older, was selected for our cohort. There are () individuals in it with average age of ().  

After plotting the individual's age, we found that people who were older than 80 years old were classified as 80 years old. A different method should be used to categorizing the age for a clearer view. 

We have got two methods. One was to categorize age into deciles, for 0 to 9, 10 to 19 and so on. Those individuals with high age would be classified in to 80+. Another one was to categorize the age into quartiles. People were classified into four gouprs: younger than 25 years, 25 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years and over 75 years old.

All the missing data were eradicated. The discriptive variables' numeric labels were relabeled and added character descriptions. For gender, we relabled them as 1 to be male and 0 to be female. The race variables were labled from 0 to 5, as Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian and Other Race, including Multi-Reacial. We also categorized the Family Monthly Poverty Level index as a binary outcome that The ratio smaller than 5 would be categorized as 0 while those equal or larger than 5 would be labelled as 1. The education category was also reorganized. The missing data and refused people were lablled as NA and eradicated. 9th to 11th grade (or no diploma) and high school grad or GED were merged into a new category: "High school/GED". Other groups maintained same or renamed: lower than 9th grade, College and College Grad+. 

The individual's Hepatitis Histories were also cleaned. For both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, only Yes and No were preserved. Refused and Don't known would be labelled as NA and eradicated with missing data. Similar process was done to the Health insurance Coverage, containing only Yes and No. The data of heptatitis B Vaccination Status were also included as Immunization Status. Excluding refused, don't known and missing data, we preserved at least three doses, less than three doses and no doses. 

In the end, we restrict the data frame to include only interested individuals. A table was included to show how many individuals are being excluded and why.
