<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Project Report</h1>

</div>


<p>Here is a group from class P8105: Data Science. In this website you
can find our final project research.</p>
<p>Our group members are all from Columbia University. You can find more
information about us from this <a href="about.html">link</a> or by
clicking on the About tab above.</p>
<div id="abstract" class="section level2">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Even though it can be effectively prevented by vaccine, <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm">Hepatitis B</a>
currently is still a significant public health concern. Infants are at
high risk of developing a chronic infection from HBV if they get
infected with the virus, whereas only 2%-6% of adults who get infected
with the virus may get chronically infected. The best way to prevent HBV
is to get vaccinated [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/index.htm">1</a>]. As it is
obvious that Hepatitis B vaccination rates vary in different
communities, our group would like to find what factors can be
statistically significantly related to an individuals’ Hepatitis B
vaccination status. Data related to vaccination status was extracted
from the <a
href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_HIQ.htm">CDC’s
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survery (NHANES) website</a>
from 2017 to pre-COVID March 2020 and cleaned. A logistic regression
model was built to explore the relationship of hepatitis B vaccination
status with a variety of factors, including age, gender, race, education
level, and insurance coverage. The final result showed that all of these
variables were significantly associated with Hepatitis B vaccination
status. The model obtained was: <strong>model = glm(formula = hepbvax ~
agecrude + gender + race + educat + insany, family =
binomial())</strong>. Our results suggest a need to consider the impact
of these factors when designing hepatitis B vaccination programs to
ensure equitable vaccination outreach and effective hepatitis B
prevention.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The Hepatitis B virus caused an estimated total of 21,600 cases of
acute infection in the United States in 2018 [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview">2</a>].
Thanks to the Hepatitis B vaccine, the ratio of new HBV infections in
the United States has maintained constantly around 1 reported cases per
100 thousand individuals in the population from 2011 to 2018 [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview">2</a>].
However, there are still 880 thousand to 1.89 million people living with
HBV infection, two thirds of whom are estimated to not even know that
they are infected [<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34097776/">3</a>,<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33655536/">4</a>].</p>
<p>The negative impact of this disease is not spread evenly. For
instance, people born outside of the United States, who account for 14%
of the US general population, account for 69% of the US population
living with chronic HBV infection. This reminds us that HBV infection
may vary greatly across different communities [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview">2</a>].</p>
<p>HBV can be transmitted via activities involving percutaneous or
mucosal contact with body fluids. Thus, sex, injection and blood contact
are major routes of transmission. It is possible for an infant to have
HBV infection from mother by giving birth [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview">2</a>]. The
virus can remain infectious outside the body for at least 7 days [<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6111645/">5</a>].</p>
<p>After being infected with hepatitis B, most children younger than 5
years old and newly infected immunosuppressed adults do not experience
symptoms. However, around 30% to 50% of people older than 5 years old
who are infected with acute hepatitis B may experience symptoms such as
fever, fatigue, nausea, and joint pain [<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18096267/">6</a>]. If the
infection becomes chronic, most people will not experience symptoms, but
some may develop hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview">2</a>].</p>
<p>In order to prevent HBV, Hepatitis B Vaccination is the best method
[<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm">7</a>].
It is recommended that people from all age ranges receive vaccination.
In the United States, the hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to
infants as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The
optimal hepatitis B vaccination schedule consists of three doses of the
vaccine, with the second dose administered one month after the first
dose and the third dose given six months after the first dose. This
schedule is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and is considered the most effective way to prevent
hepatitis B infection.</p>
<p>A hepatitis B booster series is typically given to individuals who
have previously been vaccinated against hepatitis B but have lost their
immunity to the disease. This can happen over time, especially in
individuals who have weakened immune systems due to conditions such as
HIV infection or cancer. In these cases, a booster series of hepatitis B
vaccine can help to restore immunity to the disease and protect against
infection.</p>
<p>Ideally, individuals should receive three doses of hepatitis B
vaccine to provide the best protection against infection. However,
according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), only 40.3% of adults aged 19 to 49 years and 19.1% of
adults aged over 50 years received three or more doses of the vaccine
[<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/hepb-adults-etr.html">8</a>].
Our group is interested in researching the factors that may be
significantly associated with vaccination status in order to develop new
policies that could help to increase vaccination rates. By focusing on
these factors, it may be possible to raise the hepatitis B vaccination
rate and protect more individuals from this potentially serious
disease.</p>
<p>In addition to a commitment to leveraging open source data, we also
wanted to demonstrate accessibility of research for lay members of the
public. To do this, a dashboard was created for a dynamic way of
interfacing with the data. Predictors included in the original dataset
(but not necessarily in the final model) are available so one could view
variations in vaccination of Hepatitis B across different parameters:
age (10 year span and 1 year span), insurance coverage status, sex,
race, and education. Important for the public to note is that the way
the data was loaded corresponds with the way that the NHANES study
initially categorized (for example) race and ethnicity variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>Hepatitis vaccination rates can vary among different communities
based on factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, and
insurance status. For example, older individuals may have higher
vaccination rates compared to younger individuals because they are more
likely to have received the vaccine as part of routine childhood
vaccination programs. Additionally, certain racial and ethnic minority
groups may have lower vaccination rates due to lower access to
healthcare and other barriers. Socioeconomic status can also play a
role, as individuals with lower incomes may have lower vaccination rates
due to lack of access to healthcare and other resources.</p>
<p>Prior scholarship has extensively documented a relationship between
socioeconomic factors and vaccination rates. For instance, one recent
study in the United States found that racial disparities in COVID-19
vaccination rates were associated with median income, disparity in high
school education, and vote share for the Republican party in the 2020
presidential election [<a
href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2107873118">9</a>]. An
unpublished CDC analysis of data from the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) found that Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity were both
associated with lower vaccination rates [<a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/hepb-adults-etr.html">8</a>].
This relationship was found to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>Looking at hepatitis in particular, one study from 2022 used claims
based data on 356,828 adults ≥19 years old who were continuously
enrolled in a medical benefit plan to examine adherence and completion
rates for hepatitis A and B vaccination schedules [<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8853527/">10</a>].
The authors used logistic regression analysis to conclude that lower
adherence and completion rates were broadly associated with male gender,
younger age, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower educational or
household income attainment, and medical comorbidities. Clearly, much
remains to be done to ensure disparities in who receives hepatitis B
vaccination are eventually eradicated.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Questions</h3>
<p>Our original question was focused on how health insurance related to
Hepatitis B vaccination status. Specifically, was insurance coverage
associated with changes in Hepatitis B vaccination status? And how might
that association be affected by demographic factors, such as age,
gender, race, and socioeconomic status?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-and-exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Data and Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Raw data was obtained from the <a
href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_HIQ.htm">CDC’s
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survery website</a>. This data
was chosen due to its open source nature and because one group member
has previously utilized this data set to explore research interests in a
different area. The NHANES collects data on a variety of health-related
topics, including vaccination rates, through surveys and physical
examinations of a representative sample of the US population. This data
can be used to identify trends and disparities in vaccination rates
among different groups. To conduct our study, the data set was extracted
and cleaned per the following description.</p>
<p>All the data files were saved in our github folder, and you can visit
them via <a
href="https://github.com/Meltaria/8105_FP_YH_HM_JM_MD.github.io.git">https://github.com/Meltaria/8105_FP_YH_HM_JM_MD.github.io.git</a>.
The file, <strong>nhanes</strong>, is the data frame containing all
these six distinct data files. You may taken a close look about the
detailed procedure of <a href="data_cleaning.html">data
cleaning</a>.</p>
<p>These six data sets include Alcohol Use, Demographics, Hepatitis,
Health Insurance, Immunization and Income. All the duplicated data was
eliminated and only the data from those, who are 18 years and older, was
selected for our cohort.</p>
<p>After plotting the individual’s age, we found that people who were
older than 80 years old were classified as 80 years old. We explored
multiple potential methods of solving this issue.</p>
<p>We have two primary methods. One was to categorize age into deciles,
for 0 to 9, 10 to 19 and so on. Those individuals with high age would be
classified in to 80+. Another one was to categorize the age into
quartiles. People were classified into four groups: younger than 25
years, 25 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and over 75 years old.</p>
<p>All the missing data were eradicated. The descriptive variables’
numeric labels were relabeled and added character descriptions. For
gender, we relabeled them as 1 to be male and 0 to be female. The race
variables were labeled from 0 to 5, as Mexican American, Other Hispanic,
Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian and Other
Race, including Multi-Racial. We also categorized the Family Monthly
Poverty Level index as a binary outcome where ratios smaller than 5
would be categorized as 0 while those equal or larger than 5 would be
labelled as 1. The education category was also reorganized. The missing
data and refused people were labeled as NA and eradicated. 9th to 11th
grade (or no diploma) and high school grad or GED were merged into a new
category: “High school/GED”. Other groups maintained same or renamed:
lower than 9th grade, College and College Grad+.</p>
<p>The individual’s Hepatitis Histories were also cleaned. For both
Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, only Yes and No were preserved. Refused and
Don’t known would be labelled as NA and eradicated with missing data.
Similar process was done to the Health insurance Coverage, containing
only Yes and No. The data of heptatitis B Vaccination Status were also
included as Immunization Status. Excluding refused, don’t known and
missing data, we preserved at least three doses, less than three doses
and no doses.</p>
<p>In the end, we restricted the data frame to include those individuals
we were interested in analyzing. A table was included to describe how
many individuals were excluded and why. Our final data set included
6,298 individuals with an average age of 52 years.</p>
</div>
<div id="linear-regression-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>You can find detailed linear regression procedure <a
href="linear-regression.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The data set, <strong>nhanes</strong>, contains 11 variables in
total.</p>
<p><strong>agecrude</strong>: age in years at screening</p>
<p><strong>age_decile</strong>: categorize age in every 10 years,
including: “0-9”, “10-19”, “20-29”, “30-39”, “40-49”, “50-59”, “60-69”,
“70-79”, “80+”</p>
<p><strong>age_quartile</strong>: categorize age in every 25 years,
including: “&lt;25 years”, “25-49 years”, “50-74 years”, “≥75 years”</p>
<p><strong>gender</strong>: the individual’s sex, including “Female” and
“Male”</p>
<p><strong>race</strong>: the individual’s race, including “Mexican
American”, “Other Hispanic”, “Non-Hispanic White”, “Non-Hispanic Black”,
“Non-Hispanic Asian”, “Other/Multi-Racial”</p>
<p><strong>poverty</strong>: binary outcome of poverty index, including
“Index of 0-4.99”, “Index &gt;=5”</p>
<p><strong>educat</strong>: individual’s education level, including
“&lt;9th grade”, “High school/GED”, “College”, “College Grad+”</p>
<p><strong>insany</strong>: if insurance covered, including “No”,
“Yes”</p>
<p><strong>hepb</strong>: Hepatitis B history, including “No History of
Hepatitis B”, “History of Hepatitis B”</p>
<p><strong>hepc</strong>: Hepatitis C history, including “No History of
Hepatitis C”, “History of Hepatitis C”</p>
<p><strong>hepbvax</strong>: Hepatitis B vaccination history, including
“At Least Three Doses”, “Less Than Three Doses”, “No Doses”</p>
<p>The variables were paired and plotted. Based on the plots, we can
find that, most of the variables were normal so no transformation may be
required.</p>
<p>As there are 3 age variables and we only need one variable included
in the model, three logistic regression models were built based on
different age variables.</p>
<p>Automatic selection was used to find models with age_decile,
age_quartile and agecrude. Both backward elimination and forward
selection were processed. Comparing the selection of the models, the AIC
of agecrude’s model is slightly smaller than that of age_deciles and
age_quartiles. Thus, we choose agecrude as our age variable in the
model.</p>
<p>The models we obtained from the backward elimination and forward
selection are different. <strong>fitback = glm(formula = hepbvax ~
agecrude + gender + race + educat + insany, family = binomial(), data =
nhanes_crude)</strong> for backward elimination and <strong>fitfor =
glm(formula = hepbvax ~ agecrude + gender + race + poverty + educat +
insany + hepb + hepc, family = binomial(), data = nhanes_crude)</strong>
for forward selection. Fitfor has three more predictors included,
poverty, hepb, and hepc, than fitback. Further procedure should be done
to choose one of the models.</p>
<p>We labeled fitback as the small model “fit_small” and fitfor as the
large model “fit_large”, as the fit_large simply had three more
predictors than fit_small. We set the null hypothesis H0 that: poverty,
hepb and hepc are not statistically significant to the model and the
alternative hypothesis H1 that: poverty, hepb and hepc are statistically
significant to the model.</p>
<p>Anova for logistic regression was used to compare these two models.
The p-value is 0.3299, larger than 0.05. Thus, we failed to reject the
null hypothesis and concluded that the larger model was not superior.
Thus the small model was chosen. Our model showed to be <strong>model =
glm(formula = hepbvax ~ agecrude + gender + race + educat + insany,
family = binomial(), data = nhanes_crude)</strong> (Tab. 1). The virtual
test of the prediction power of the linear regression model was also
built (Fig. 1)</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Our final model showed that the age, gender, race, education level
and insurance coverage are significantly associated with vaccination
status.</p>
<p>The “agecrude” and “genderMale” terms have positive estimate
coefficients of 0.063 and 0.535, respectively. It indicates that older
people may be more likely take vaccination than younger ones and males
may be more willing to take vaccination than females. These two terms’
p-values are extremely small, lower than 0.001, indicating they are
significantly associated with vaccination status.</p>
<p>The “race” predictor was negative for all its terms’ estimate
coefficients. Black race has the largest coefficient to be -0.118, which
could suggest Black individuals might be more likely to be vaccinated
against Hepatitis B than individuals of other races, comparing
Hispanics’ -0.433, Whites’ -0.345, and Asians’ -0.496. However, Black
race also has the p.value 0.328, much larger than 0.05, indicating Black
Race, similar to the Multi-Racial category, is not associated with
vaccination status at a statistically significant level. Asian race has
the largest magnitude of a decrease in the probability of being
vaccinated, compared with other races that demonstrated statistically
significant associations with vaccination status.</p>
<p>According to the estimated coefficient for education, it looks like
that people with higher education level are less likely to take
vaccination. People with higher education level plays a more significant
role in vaccination conditions according to their p-values smaller than
0.001.</p>
<p>It is also surprising that even with insurance coverage, people are
still less likely to take vaccination as the estimated coefficient is
-0.494. With such a large effect size and a p-value smaller than 0.001,
it showed us that insurance coverage is associated with vaccine uptake,
although not in the direction we initially expected. Perhaps this is due
to increased vaccine hesitancy in this group or another confounding
factor we don’t yet anticipate.</p>
<p>The original dataset contained multiple variables that ultimately
were not included in the cleaned dataset. Additional issues with how the
data was coded included having varied missing data or incomplete data,
leading to limited ability to incorporate granularity in the data. For
example, there were multiple missing data responses for the different
insurance types including Medicare. Race and ethnicity were also
conflated in the data collection. As discussed in our section on data
cleaning, the categorization of age in the raw data required some
grouping to avoid clustering all individuals above the age of 80 years
as being 80 years old. Some variables, such as Alcohol Use, were not
included, due to the raw data being too messy to depend on in our
analysis. Lastly, as the data was collected from 2017 up until the
pandemic onset (March 2020), it may have limited generalizability to
present-day factors.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From the model we obtained in this research, we are able to find
which variables can be significantly associated with Hepatitis B
vaccination status. Age, gender, most races, education level and
insurance coverage demonstrate statistically significant associations
with Hepatitis B vaccination status. In the future, more detailed
research can be done by focusing on the mechanisms of these
associations. Additionally, researchers should examine how potential
public health policies, such as changing the vaccine schedule from 3
doses to 2 doses, may impact individuals’ likelihood of getting
vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Further Research</h2>
<p>After tests, we were not satisfied the prediction power of our linear
regression model. We concluded it was because linear regression didn’t
fit our data too well. Therefore, we decided to adopt the multinomial
logistic regression model with the same predictors. The model we
obtained was <strong>multinom(formula = hepbvax ~ agecrude + gender +
race + educat + insany, data = nhanes_crude)</strong> (Fig.2).</p>
<p><img src="linear-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" style="width:75%"></p>
<p>While we tried to show the prediction power of our new model, an
interesting question came to our mind: is there a relationship between
age_crude and the prediction power of our model? We organized the data,
and made some calculations. The final graph answered this question: for
people older than 40, the accuracy rises as the age increases
(Fig.3).</p>
